# 👋 Hey — I'm Halldor!
## Software Engineer | Backend • Cloud • IoT • Systems Integration

I'm a software engineer with a mechatronics background and 10 years of experience building robust backend systems, cloud-native microservices, and connected IoT solutions.

I love working at the intersection of the digital and the physical — designing systems that bridge embedded devices, cloud services, and real-world applications.

### 🚗 Cars + Code

Outside of work, I write on [Engineer-A-Car](https://www.engineeracar.com) — a blog where I explore vehicle systems through code, projects, and tutorials.

My goal is to help other makers, tinkerers, and engineers to learn and build with confidence.
