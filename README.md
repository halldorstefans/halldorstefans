## Who Am I?

I'm a graduated car mechanic turned coder who thrives on creating useful things.

After completing my car mechanic studies, I pursued a university education. There, I discovered the world of programming and got instantly hooked!

Since then, I've been passionate about crafting solutions to improve people's lives. Whether it's a simple weather dashboard for my girlfriend or integrations to streamline tasks to minimise manual work, I love the challenge.

My focus is on bringing people together to solve problems efficiently. I specialise in developing software solutions that simplify processes and improve operations. That involves fostering a cohesive team, making data-based decisions, and committing to continuous learning.

Feel free to contact me if you're interested in discussing exciting opportunities, working on cool projects, or just chatting about classic cars.
