# Hey - I'm Halldor! ðŸ‘‹
## Software Engineer - From Cars to Cloud

**I build integrated systems by bridging automotive, cloud and IoT.**

## About Me In 8 Seconds

Initially studied to become a car mechanic before shifting gears to earn a degree in Mechatronics.

Currently, I'm working as a software engineer who loves designing, and building systems.

## Let's Connect!

Beyond work, I explore the intersection of cars and code through hands-on projects on my blog, [Engineer-A-Car](https://www.engineeracar.com/).
