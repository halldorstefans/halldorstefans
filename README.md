## Software Engineer - From Cars to Cloud

**I build integrated systems by bridging automotive, cloud and IoT systems.**

## About Me In 8 Seconds

I tried to be a car mechanic before shifting gears to earn a degree in Mechatronics.

Now, I work as a software engineer who loves learning, building and innovating things.

## What I Do

- **Solution Design:** Design and develop cohesive systems, enabling real-time data processing and enhanced operational efficiency
- **System Integrations:** Expert in bridging traditional systems with modern cloud platforms, using technologies like Go, Docker, and Kafka to create robust, scalable solutions
- **Technical Leadership:** With a proven track record in leading teams and advancing agile software development processes
- **System-Level Thinking:** Combine software expertise with a mechatronics background to deliver solutions considering digital and physical constraints

## Let's Connect!

Beyond work, I explore blending hardware and software through hands-on projects, as detailed on my blog, [Engineer-A-Car](https://www.engineeracar.com/).
